  "content": "The action in LALIGA EA SPORTS continues with a midweek round taking place across Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Two of the Matchday 7 fixtures, those involving Spain’s Europa League participants, have already taken place, as Athletic Club won 2-0 at CD Leganés and Real Sociedad fell 1-0 at RCD Mallorca last week. Now, it’s time for the remaining eight fixtures of Matchday 7 and there are some intriguing contests on the schedule. The midweek action commences with two games taking place simultaneously at 19:00 CEST on Tuesday, and both are huge for the home teams in particular. Sevilla FC just suffered their third defeat of the season, meaning the pressure is still on new coach García Pimienta, so their home clash with Real Valladolid is of massive importance. Meanwhile, Valencia CF remain in the relegation zone despite securing their first victory of the season in Matchday 6, so Rubén Baraja’s charges will hope to make it two wins in a row when they welcome CA Osasuna to Mestalla. There is one more Tuesday fixture, with Real Madrid taking on Deportivo Alavés at the Bernabéu at 21:00 CEST. The Basque side have been one of the revelations of the 2024/25 season, having collected 10 points already from their first six games, so they could make life difficult for the reigning champions in this one. On Wednesday, there are two more games and they both take place in Catalonia, with the first being Girona FC vs Rayo Vallecano. These two teams met on three occasions across all competitions last season and Girona FC won all three of those contests, but the Catalan outfit have had a mixed start to this season, meaning coach Míchel could find it more difficult this time against his former club. Next up, at 21:00 CEST on Wednesday, the league leaders are in action as FC Barcelona face off against Getafe CF at the Estadi Olímpic. Since they were last promoted up to LALIGA EA SPORTS, Getafe CF have managed to take points off Barça at least once in five of these seven seasons, so Los Blaugranas will have to be alert in this one. Three more games follow on Thursday, and there is another double kick-off at 19:00 CEST with UD Las Palmas vs Real Betis and RCD Espanyol vs Villarreal CF. In the case of UD Las Palmas, they’re now bottom of the table on just two points and desperately need a win, so that should be an interesting game when the ball gets rolling on the island. As for RCD Espanyol and Villarreal CF, both teams have started the season better than many expected, but they know they need to keep picking up points to achieve their objectives. The final game of Matchday 7 takes place in Galicia, where RC Celta and Atlético de Madrid will square off. Atleti won 3-0 in Vigo last season thanks to an Antoine Griezmann hat-trick and the Frenchman has started this new season in excellent form, so he’ll hope to lead his team to another three-point haul to keep Los Colchoneros in the title race discussion."
